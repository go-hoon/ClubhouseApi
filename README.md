# ðŸ‘‹ Clubhouse Api
### Building a Clubhouse clone!

This project is my journey to recreate some of the core features of [Clubhouse](https://www.clubhouse.com/), the popular audio-based social app. It's all about pushing my limits and learning new things, with two main goals:

- **Level up my C# and .NET game**: I'll be tackling everything from setting up basic REST APIs, networking, connecting to databases and implementing a CI/CD pipeline. This hands-on experience will solidify my understanding of C# and .NET.
- **Real-time communication features**: Clubhouse's live audio and dynamic engagement are what make it tick. This project will teach me technologies to enable real-time communication between client and server.
